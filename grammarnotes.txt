General:
    Cree has 2 grammatical genders, Animate and Inanimate. Generally, things that are actually animate in real life are
        animate, but things that aren't can be either.
    Cree has a distinction between obviate and proximate in inflection. Only one noun at a time can be marked as
        proximate at a time and all others are therefore obviate. The proximate argument is the topic, or is in some
        other way more "close" to the speaker or discourse.
    Cree has clusivity in the first person plural. Inclusive includes the 2nd person, Exclusive doesn't.
    Cree morphophonology is pretty complicated, meaning surface forms of various conjugations often appear less
        connected than they underlyingly are, due to the deletion/alteration of morphemes. For a look at how these
        morphemes actually pattern in the underlying forms, check the conjugations dictionary in the file named after
        the verb type you're interested in (VAI.py or VII.py). This might help you understand the conjugations better.
        For example, the 0 singular suffix in the independent paradigm is underlyingly /-wi/, but it's often reduced to
        /-Ã˜/ or /-w/ in various forms (e.g. /ispayin/-/wi/ > /ispayin/ in the independent singular proximate, but
        /ispayin/-/eyi/-/wi/ > /ispayiniyiw/ in the independent singular obviate.
    The standard roman orthography for Cree marks long vowels with the macron or circumflex diacritic, but due to
        technical limitations, this program also accepts double vowels in the input.
